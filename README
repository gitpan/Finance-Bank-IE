Bank Of Ireland, MBNA Ireland (actually MBNA Europe), and Permanent
TSB (Ireland) online banking access, based on existing
Finance::Banking interface.

BankOfIreland.pm is the most complete in that it covers funds
transfer. All public functions take a hashref as an optional last
parameter to specify the credentials to be used if a login page is
encountered. The credentials are cached in the class and will be
retrieved from same if none are provided.

See individual perldocs and sample code for more.

As noted by the code on which I based this: these modules are intended
to access your money online. Be cautious with them!
