Bank Of Ireland and MBNA Ireland (actually MBNA Europe) online banking
access, based on existing Finance::Banking interface.

Finance::Bank::IE::BankOfIreland supports check_balance and
account_details methods. Finance::Bank::IE::MBNA supports the
check_balance method.

MBNA check_balance takes a username & password. BoI check_balance
takes a hash containing user => username, pin => 6-digit PIN, contact
=> last four digits of contact number, dob => date of birth in
DD/MM/YYYY format.

check_balance for both returns the account number, the currency, and
the balance, since that's all I get to work with from the
websites. Also, the account numbers are only partial. MBNA account
info also includes a 'minimum due' field, currently ripped straight
off the page and stashed in $_->{min} in the form "<amt> due by
<date>".
