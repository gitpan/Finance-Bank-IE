0.21 2009-12-02T00:00:00Z
    Now we have real tests for the BoI module. Additionally, there's
    an activate_beneficiary function, and some perldocs (incomplete).

0.20 2009-11-05T00:00:00Z
    Previous update broke account detail due to an omitted backslash. (no
    fault of Audun!) Serves me right for not testing properly.

0.19 2009-10-13T00:00:00Z
    Update to BoI fetching of multiple pages in account detail (courtesy of
      Audun)

    Update MBNA for layout changes

0.13 2008-07-15T00:00:00Z
    Use old BoI address, as both Safari and WWW::Mechanize can't cope
    with the new one and I don't know why not.

0.12 2008-06-05T00:00:00Z
    Missed one of the MBNA layout changes. Also, I added some sanity
    checking to the BoI beneficiaries code; it now checks that a
    beneficiary is active before letting you use it.

0.11 2008-04-27T00:00:00Z
    BoI layout changed again, as did some of the MBNA layout.

0.10 2007-10-19T00:00:00Z
    BoI layout changed in mid-October 2007. Code is somewhat more robust in
    that it will now bail out when it can't parse things instead of returning
    undef. One minor regression in functionality: the account transfer used
    understand your own bank account nicknames both as source and
    destination. Due to formatting changes the nickname as destination no
    longer works. You can probably fix this by setting a nickname on the
    account in the third-party beneficiaries list, where BoI seem to inevitably
    list your non-third-party accounts regardless of what ever else you do.
