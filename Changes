    Missed one of the MBNA layout changes. Also, I added some sanity
    checking to the BoI beneficiaries code; it now checks that a
    beneficiary is active before letting you use it.

0.11
    BoI layout changed again, as did some of the MBNA layout.

0.10
	BoI layout changed in mid-October 2007. Code is somewhat more robust in
	that it will now bail out when it can't parse things instead of returning
	undef. One minor regression in functionality: the account transfer used
	understand your own bank account nicknames both as source and
	destination. Due to formatting changes the nickname as destination no
	longer works. You can probably fix this by setting a nickname on the
	account in the third-party beneficiaries list, where BoI seem to inevitably
	list your non-third-party accounts regardless of what ever else you do.
