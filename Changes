    * Date::Parse on OpenBSD apparently doesn't parse 01/01/1970.

    * BoI advertising their app on the login page screws up the login.
    * Rudimentary render-as-QIF support
    * Bumped all $VERSIONs to match release

    an activate_beneficiary function, and some perldocs (incomplete).

0.20
    Previous update broke account detail due to an omitted backslash. (no
    fault of Audun!) Serves me right for not testing properly.

    Update MBNA for layout changes

0.13
    Use old BoI address, as both Safari and WWW::Mechanize can't cope
    with the new one and I don't know why not.

0.12
    Missed one of the MBNA layout changes. Also, I added some sanity
    checking to the BoI beneficiaries code; it now checks that a
    beneficiary is active before letting you use it.

0.11
    BoI layout changed again, as did some of the MBNA layout.

0.10
    BoI layout changed in mid-October 2007. Code is somewhat more robust in
    that it will now bail out when it can't parse things instead of returning
    undef. One minor regression in functionality: the account transfer used
    understand your own bank account nicknames both as source and
    destination. Due to formatting changes the nickname as destination no
    longer works. You can probably fix this by setting a nickname on the
    account in the third-party beneficiaries list, where BoI seem to inevitably
    list your non-third-party accounts regardless of what ever else you do.
